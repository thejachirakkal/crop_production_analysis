This is a data analysis on crop production of india... Crop production is the process of growing and harvesting plants for food, fiber, fuel, or other purposes. It's the foundation of agriculture and plays a crucial role in feeding the world's population EACH FEATURE TELLS IN THE DATASET:

- Crop: The type of crop that was cultivated.
- Area: The area of land used for cultivating the specified crop.
- Production: The production quantity of the crop. CONCLUSIONS DRAWN 1997 is the most least produced for most crops the reasons may be the severe drought that affected the main agricultural areas like uttar pradesh , bihar etc and the elnino affect which affected the weather in india . the monsoon arrived late and the rain was not significant for the agricultural industry bihar is coming in the top list of producers by states in most season crops but still bihar is facing the top in poverty list in india which half the population suffers from deprivation across various indicators like health, education, and living standards.,Over 70% of Bihar's population relies on agriculture for their livelihood. While crop production is high, factors like low productivity,focus on subsistence crops,caste and landownership,gender inequality,poor infrastructure , weak governance etc chandigarh is least contributed to agriculture in india mainly because being a union territory it has very limited land area for cultuvation and chandigarh mainly focuses on administrative and commercial center and also they recieve low rainfall compared to other areas andaman and nicobar islands least contributed to agriculture because of island geography and mainly focused on tourism and transportation challenges also are faced because the transportations to and fro island will become costly dadra and nagar haveli also least contributors because being union territory limited land area and a sizeable portion is covered by forests and also it has witnessed significant industrial development It's important to remember that these regions contribute to India's food security in other ways. Chandigarh plays a vital role in administrative and technological aspects of agriculture. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a growing horticulture sector, including fruits and vegetables. Andaman and Nicobar Islands contribute to niche agricultural products like coconuts and spices. Kharif is the most frequent season, followed by Rabi and Whole Year, indicating significant crop cultivation. Uttar pradesh is the leading state in crop production followed by madhya pradesh , karnataka ,maharashtra ... excluding uttar pradesh when considered other state came to understand that mp , karnataka , maharashtra were leading in top suicides in india that too by farmers (https://github.com/shabnammohamedbasheer/SUICIDE-RATES-IN-INDIA) this was an analysis done earlier by me which brought an insight that just by high production in crops doesnt eradicate the top producers from suicide or poverty the reason mainly is the less knowledge on agriculture , out dated farming practises , mainly focusing on staple crops , social and structural issue , gender inequality and so on... Certain measures can be followed to boost crop production sustainable practices , technology adoption , improved infrastructure , seed and research , diversifying crops ,skill development etc...
